The purpose of this app is to plan out class paths and needed skills for Fire Emblem: Three Houses playthroughs.

# To Do

[x] User creates a new playthrough and chooses their house - auto-add those house's students
[x] Also choose paths for Byleth & choose gender for correct character image
[x] Add students to roster
[ ] Delete students from roster
[x] User selects class paths for characters and the app displays what skills they need
[ ] Can skip class levels e.g. go from Beginner to Master class, or current to Unique skipping others
[x] User can check off skills they've acquired the needed level for
[ ] Display when a character is ready for a new certification based on checked off skills
[x] Display skills needed for next class in path when skills for previous class are reached
[ ] When user is choosing class path, show what % other users chose
[x] Keep track of previous playthrough data even if user starts a new one
[ ] Add character/class gender and prevent wrong gender from using class e.g. Gremory cannot be male
[ ] Add unique classes and connect to character, only show unique option when choosing classes if they have one
[ ] Add DLC and special classes
[ ] Add recruitable boolean to students and don't allow to add non-recruitable characters (e.g. other house leaders)

# Other Feature Ideas

[ ] On class selection page, filter for skill type - maybe only show filters for character's best skills
[ ] Select skill goals post master class (or along path)
[ ] Character gift guide
[ ] Tea Party guides
[ ] Track support levels
